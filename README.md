## Drumkit Web App

This is a simple drumkit web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play drum sounds by pressing keys on the keyboard. The app is a fun, interactive demo that showcases basic DOM manipulation and CSS animations.

#Features: 
Keyboard Controls: Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a specific drum sound. CSS Animations: Keys are highlighted with a subtle animation when pressed. Responsive Design: Works across different screen sizes for a seamless experience. Demo Link to the live demo (if hosted online)



#How It Works: 
Each key on the keyboard is linked to a specific drum sound file. When a key is pressed, an event listener triggers the associated sound and adds a visual effect. The visual effect is removed once the sound completes, creating a responsive, dynamic feel. Technologies Used HTML: For the app structure. CSS: For styling and animations. JavaScript: For handling keyboard events and playing sounds.
