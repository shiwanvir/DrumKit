# Drumkit Web App

This is a simple drumkit web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play drum sounds by pressing keys on the keyboard. The app is a fun, interactive demo that showcases basic DOM manipulation and CSS animations.

## Features

- **Keyboard Controls**: Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a specific drum sound.
- **CSS Animations**: Keys are highlighted with a subtle animation when pressed.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes for a seamless experience.

## How It Works

1. Each key on the keyboard is linked to a specific drum sound file.
2. When a key is pressed, an event listener triggers the associated sound and adds a visual effect.
3. The visual effect is removed once the sound completes, creating a responsive, dynamic feel.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the app structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For handling keyboard events and playing sounds.
